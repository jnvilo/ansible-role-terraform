Installs terraform command line 

## What is terraform Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool designed to automate and manage the provisioning of infrastructure resources in a declarative and scalable manner. It allows users to define their infrastructure configurations using code, typically in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), making it possible to create, modify, and destroy cloud resources across various platforms (like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.) through simple, version-controlled configuration files. Terraform abstracts the complexities of interacting with different cloud providers' APIs, enabling consistent and repeatable deployments while facilitating collaboration among development and operations teams. Its state management capabilities ensure that the actual infrastructure matches the intended configuration, and its modular approach allows for the composition of complex architectures using reusable building blocks.
